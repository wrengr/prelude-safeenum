prelude-safeenum
================

This is a very simple package and should be easy to install. You
should be able to use any of the following standard methods to
install it.

    -- With cabal-install and without the source:
    $> cabal install prelude-safeenum
    
    -- With cabal-install and with the source already:
    $> cd prelude-safeenum
    $> cabal install
    
    -- Without cabal-install, but with the source already:
    $> cd prelude-safeenum
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs configure --user
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs build
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs test
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs haddock --hyperlink-source
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs copy
    $> runhaskell Setup.hs register

The test step is optional and currently does nothing. The Haddock
step is also optional.


Portability
===========

An attempt has been made to keep this library portable; however,
it does rely on a few language extensions. All the required language
extensions are:

    CPP
    GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving
    MagicHash  -- only needed by GHC.

The GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving extension is used for brevity in
Data.Number.CalkinWilf. If you'd like to use this package with a
compiler that does not support that extension, contact the maintainer
and it can be removed.
